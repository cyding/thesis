    Vision problems such as near-sightedness, far-sightedness, as well as
  others, are due to optical aberrations in the human eye. These conditions are
  prevalent, and the population is growing rapidly. Correcting optical
  aberrations is traditionally done optically using eyeglasses, contact lenses,
  or refractive surgeries; these are sometime not convenient or not always
  available to everyone. Furthermore, higher order aberrations are not
  correctable with eyeglasses. In this work, we introduce a new computation
  based aberration-correcting light field display: by incorporating the
  personâ€™s own optical aberration into the computation, we alter the content
  shown on the display, such that he or she will be able to see it in sharp
  focus without wearing eyewear. We analyze the image formation models; through
  the retinal light field projection, we find it is possible to compensate for
  the optical blurring on the target image by prefiltering with the inverse
  blur. Using off-the-shelf components, we built a light field display
  prototype that supports our desired inverse light field prefiltering. The
  results show a significant contrast improvement and resolution enhancement
  over prior approaches. Finally, we also demonstrate the capability to correct
  for higher order aberrations.%

    The purpose of the vision correcting display is to enable the viewer who
  has eye aberrations to see the display in sharp focus without requiring the
  use of eyeglasses or contact lenses. Fu-Chung Huang et al. proposed two
  different solutions to this problem. In the first one, they use a multilayer
  display [10], and in the second one they utilize light field technology to
  generate a sharp image from the display plane [11]. In this paper, we present
  three major software improvements that have been made upon the light field
  idea, including the forward method, optimization of the forward method and
  the improvement on projection and prefiltering. One major hardware
  improvement has been proposed, which replaces the pinhole array to a
  microlens array for the purpose of creating the light field. We develop a
  simulation program to better evaluate the result.%
