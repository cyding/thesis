abstract = {Objective: To compare US population prevalence estimates for myopia in 1971-1972 and 1999-2004. Methods: The 1971-1972 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided the earliest nationally representative estimates for US myopia prevalence; myopia was diagnosed by an algorithm using either lensometry, pinhole visual acuity, and presenting visual acuity (for presenting visual acuity ≥20/40) or retinoscopy (for presenting visual acuity ≤20/50). Using a similar method for diagnosing myopia, we examined data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to determine whether myopia prevalence had changed during the 30 years between the 2 surveys. Results: Using the 1971-1972 method, the estimated prevalence of myopia in persons aged 12 to 54 years was significantly higher in 1999-2004 than in 1971-1972 (41.6% vs 25.0%, respectively; P-2.0 diopters [D]: 17.5% vs 13.4%, respectively [P-7.9 D: 22.4% vs 11.4%, respectively [P},

    Abstract = {We are building upon our earlier work in Vision-Realistic Rendering, which is the computation of a displayed image that incorporates the characteristics of a particular individual’s entire optical system.  The key concept is, given the optical measurements of an individual’s optical system, perform an “inverse blurring” computation on what would normally be displayed such that when this blurred version of the display is then viewed by this individual, it will appear in sharp focus when viewed by the individual whose optical system was used for this inverse blurring computation. There are two major impediments to performing inverse blurring: the generated image will have large, and even negative, values for some intensities, and some frequencies are lost after blurring.  Building a high dynamic range display system will overcome the large/negative intensities problems. Introducing multiple layers of display with each layer located at a different viewing distance will overcome the lost frequencies. Next, there is the question of occlusion due to the multiple layers.  One solution would be to use transparent displays, but if they cannot support high dynamic range imaging then an alternative is to construct a light-path-modulating system using mirrors to change the path of lights. The potential benefits are enormous for people who require vision correction, especially those whose optical problems include high-order aberrations since these aberrations are not corrected by eyeglasses.  One application would involve construction of an “Aberration Compensated Display” in which the display would show images that have been transformed by inverse blurring individualized to the viewer such that when viewed by his or her optical system the resulting image will appear sharp.  This will be useful for displays for computer monitors and hand-held mobile devices such as tablets and mobile phones.}

    Abstract = {Vision problems such as near-sightedness, far-sightedness, as well as others, are due to optical aberrations in the human eye. These conditions are prevalent, and the population is growing rapidly. Correcting optical aberrations is traditionally done optically using eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgeries; these are sometime not convenient or not always available to everyone. Furthermore, higher order aberrations are not correctable with eyeglasses.

In this work, we introduce a new computation based aberration-correcting light field display: by incorporating the person’s own optical aberration into the computation, we alter the content shown on the display, such that he or she will be able to see it in sharp focus without wearing eyewear. We analyze the image formation models; through the retinal light field projection, we find it is possible to compensate for the optical blurring on the target image by prefiltering with the inverse blur. 

Using off-the-shelf components, we built a light field display prototype that supports our desired inverse light field prefiltering. The results show a significant contrast improvement and resolution enhancement over prior approaches. Finally, we also demonstrate the capability to correct for higher order aberrations.}

    Abstract = {The purpose of the vision correcting display is to enable the viewer who has eye aberrations to see the display in sharp focus without requiring the use of eyeglasses or contact lenses. Fu-Chung Huang et al. proposed two different solutions to this problem. In the first one, they use a multilayer display [10], and in the second one they utilize light field technology to generate a sharp image from the display plane [11].
In this paper, we present three major software improvements that have been made upon the light field idea, including the forward method, optimization of the forward method and the improvement on projection and prefiltering. One major hardware improvement has been proposed, which replaces the pinhole array to a microlens array for the purpose of creating the light field. We develop a simulation program to better evaluate the result.}

abstract="We study the numerical performance of a limited memory quasi-Newton method for large scale optimization, which we call the L-BFGS method. We compare its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems.",
