\chapter{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the results of the physical experiment and software simulation show that the vision correcting display drastically improves the quality of vision for people with eye aberrations. As the number of people with vision problems increases and the time people spend on digital screens increases, new methods for correcting aberrations will become more and more necessary. The backward method proposed runs faster than the comprehensive version of Huang's algorithm and produces clearer images than the forward method depending on the light field display and angular resolution. The forward method and simulation algorithm work well regardless of the pixel arrangement of the device. The wave optics simulation takes into account diffraction through the pinhole mask and has many applications in optical physics. 

In the future, vision correcting displays will present a viable alternative to eyeglasses, contact lenses, and refractive eye surgery for people who want to view screens clearly. With the rapid increase in computing power, the algorithms will be able to run in real-time. Eye tracking software will be able to determine the parameters like distance to the eye. The next time a person watches TV or reads from a phone, he or she will not even remember his or her eye problems.
